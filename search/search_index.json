DateTime interactionStatistic The number of interactions for the CreativeWork using the WebSite or SoftwareApplication. The most specific child type of InteractionCounter should be used. InteractionCounter headline Headline of the article. Text sdLicense A license document that applies to this structured data, typically indicated by URL. URL acquireLicensePage Indicates a page documenting how licenses can be purchased or otherwise acquired, for the current item. URL review A review of the item. Review creditText Text that can be used to credit person(s) and/or organization(s) associated with a published Creative Work. Text associatedMedia A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for encoding. MediaObject schemaVersion Indicates (by URL or string) a particular version of a schema used in some CreativeWork. This property was created primarily to indicate the use of a specific schema.org release, e.g. 10.0 as a simple string, or more explicitly via URL, https://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v10.0 . There may be situations in which other schemas might usefully be referenced this way, e.g. http://dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dces/1999-07-02/ but this has not been carefully explored in the community. URL digitalSourceType Indicates an IPTCDigitalSourceEnumeration code indicating the nature of the digital source(s) for some [[CreativeWork]]. IPTCDigitalSourceEnumeration producer The person or organization who produced the work (e.g. music album, movie, TV/radio series etc.). Person contributor A secondary contributor to the CreativeWork or Event. Person isAccessibleForFree A flag to signal that the item, event, or place is accessible for free. Boolean accessibilityHazard A characteristic of the described resource that is physiologically dangerous to some users. Related to WCAG 2.0 guideline 2.3. Values should be drawn from the approved vocabulary . Text about The subject matter of the content. Thing countryOfOrigin The country of origin of something, including products as well as creative works such as movie and TV content. In the case of TV and movie, this would be the country of the principle offices of the production company or individual responsible for the movie. For other kinds of [[CreativeWork]] it is difficult to provide fully general guidance, and properties such as [[contentLocation]] and [[locationCreated]] may be more applicable. In the case of products, the country of origin of the product. The exact interpretation of this may vary by context and product type, and cannot be fully enumerated here. Country encodings A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. MediaObject locationCreated The location where the CreativeWork was created, which may not be the same as the location depicted in the CreativeWork. Place maintainer A maintainer of a [[Dataset]], software package ([[SoftwareApplication]]), or other [[Project]]. A maintainer is a [[Person]] or [[Organization]] that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on \"upstream\" sources. When [[maintainer]] is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a [[Dataset]], it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The [[isBasedOn]] property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work. Person inLanguage The language of the content or performance or used in an action. Please use one of the language codes from the IETF BCP 47 standard . See also [[availableLanguage]]. Text assesses The item being described is intended to assess the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. Text editEIDR An EIDR (Entertainment Identifier Registry) [[identifier]] representing a specific edit / edition for a work of film or television. For example, the motion picture known as \"Ghostbusters\" whose [[titleEIDR]] is \"10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J\" has several edits, e.g. \"10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I\" and \"10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3\". Since schema.org types like [[Movie]] and [[TVEpisode]] can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use [[titleEIDR]] alone (for a general description), or alongside [[editEIDR]] for a more edit-specific description. URL pattern A pattern that something has, for example 'polka dot', 'striped', 'Canadian flag'. Values are typically expressed as text, although links to controlled value schemes are also supported. Text citation A citation or reference to another creative work, such as another publication, web page, scholarly article, etc. Text encoding A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for associatedMedia. MediaObject accessibilitySummary A human-readable summary of specific accessibility features or deficiencies, consistent with the other accessibility metadata but expressing subtleties such as \"short descriptions are present but long descriptions will be needed for non-visual users\" or \"short descriptions are present and no long descriptions are needed\".

E.g. \u897f\u904a\u8a18 has an English workTranslation \u201cJourney to the West\u201d, a German workTranslation \u201cMonkeys Pilgerfahrt\u201d and a Vietnamese translation T\u00e2y du k\u00fd b\u00ecnh kh\u1ea3o. CreativeWork releasedEvent The place and time the release was issued, expressed as a PublicationEvent. PublicationEvent commentCount The number of comments this CreativeWork (e.g. Article, Question or Answer) has received. This is most applicable to works published in Web sites with commenting system; additional comments may exist elsewhere. Integer copyrightNotice Text of a notice appropriate for describing the copyright aspects of this Creative Work, ideally indicating the owner of the copyright for the Work. Text educationalAlignment An alignment to an established educational framework. This property should not be used where the nature of the alignment can be described using a simple property, for example to express that a resource [[teaches]] or [[assesses]] a competency. AlignmentObject author The author of this content or rating. Please note that author is special in that HTML 5 provides a special mechanism for indicating authorship via the rel tag. That is equivalent to this and may be used interchangeably. Person exampleOfWork A creative work that this work is an example/instance/realization/derivation of. CreativeWork temporal The \"temporal\" property can be used in cases where more specific properties (e.g. [[temporalCoverage]], [[dateCreated]], [[dateModified]], [[datePublished]]) are not known to be appropriate. Text keywords Keywords or tags used to describe some item. Multiple textual entries in a keywords list are typically delimited by commas, or by repeating the property. URL accountablePerson Specifies the Person that is legally accountable for the CreativeWork. Person archivedAt Indicates a page or other link involved in archival of a [[CreativeWork]]. In the case of [[MediaReview]], the items in a [[MediaReviewItem]] may often become inaccessible, but be archived by archival, journalistic, activist, or law enforcement organizations. In such cases, the referenced page may not directly publish the content. WebPage correction Indicates a correction to a [[CreativeWork]], either via a [[CorrectionComment]], textually or in another document. URL funder A person or organization that supports (sponsors) something through some kind of financial contribution.

Text material A material that something is made from, e.g. leather, wool, cotton, paper. URL offers An offer to provide this item\u2014for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use [[businessFunction]] to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a [[Demand]]. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer. Offer copyrightHolder The party holding the legal copyright to the CreativeWork. Person editor Specifies the Person who edited the CreativeWork. Person materialExtent The quantity of the materials being described or an expression of the physical space they occupy. Text fileFormat Media type, typically MIME format (see IANA site ) of the content, e.g. application/zip of a SoftwareApplication binary. In cases where a CreativeWork has several media type representations, 'encoding' can be used to indicate each MediaObject alongside particular fileFormat information. Unregistered or niche file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia entry. URL genre Genre of the creative work, broadcast channel or group. URL reviews Review of the item. Review publishingPrinciples The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via [[URL]]) a document describing the editorial principles of an [[Organization]] (or individual, e.g. a [[Person]] writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a [[CreativeWork]] (e.g. [[NewsArticle]]) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the [[CreativeWork]]. While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a [[funder]]) can be expressed using schema.org terminology. URL accessibilityFeature Content features of the resource, such as accessible media, alternatives and supported enhancements for accessibility. Values should be drawn from the approved vocabulary . Text spatialCoverage The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York. Place sdDatePublished Indicates the date on which the current structured data was generated / published. Typically used alongside [[sdPublisher]]. Date conditionsOfAccess Conditions that affect the availability of, or method(s) of access to, an item. Typically used for real world items such as an [[ArchiveComponent]] held by an [[ArchiveOrganization]]. This property is not suitable for use as a general Web access control mechanism. It is expressed only in natural language.\\n\\nFor example \"Available by appointment from the Reading Room\" or \"Accessible only from logged-in accounts \". Text thumbnail Thumbnail image for an image or video. ImageObject sponsor A person or organization that supports a thing through a pledge, promise, or financial contribution. E.g. a sponsor of a Medical Study or a corporate sponsor of an event. Person isPartOf Indicates an item or CreativeWork that this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense), is part of. URL copyrightYear The year during which the claimed copyright for the CreativeWork was first asserted. Number dateCreated The date on which the CreativeWork was created or the item was added to a DataFeed. DateTime position The position of an item in a series or sequence of items. Text educationalLevel The level in terms of progression through an educational or training context. Examples of educational levels include 'beginner', 'intermediate' or 'advanced', and formal sets of level indicators. URL temporalCoverage The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format . In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written \"2011/2012\"). Other forms of content, e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode, may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via \"1939/1945\". Open-ended date ranges can be written with \"..\" in place of the end date. For example, \"2015-11/..\" indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. URL typicalAgeRange The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'. Text publisher The publisher of the creative work. Person sdPublisher Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site. For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing content with more explicitly structured metadata. The [[sdPublisher]] property helps make such practices more explicit. Person workExample Example/instance/realization/derivation of the concept of this creative work.

Text usageInfo The schema.org [[usageInfo]] property indicates further information about a [[CreativeWork]]. This property is applicable both to works that are freely available and to those that require payment or other transactions. It can reference additional information, e.g. community expectations on preferred linking and citation conventions, as well as purchasing details. For something that can be commercially licensed, usageInfo can provide detailed, resource-specific information about licensing options. This property can be used alongside the license property which indicates license(s) applicable to some piece of content. The usageInfo property can provide information about other licensing options, e.g. acquiring commercial usage rights for an image that is also available under non-commercial creative commons licenses. URL audio An embedded audio object. MusicRecording comment Comments, typically from users. Comment award An award won by or for this item. Text alternativeHeadline A secondary title of the CreativeWork. Text expires Date the content expires and is no longer useful or available. For example a [[VideoObject]] or [[NewsArticle]] whose availability or relevance is time-limited, a [[ClaimReview]] fact check whose publisher wants to indicate that it may no longer be relevant (or helpful to highlight) after some date, or a [[Certification]] the validity has expired.

Place url URL of the item. URL mainEntityOfPage Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See background notes for details. URL potentialAction Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. Action description A description of the item. TextObject additionalType An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide . URL identifier The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of [[Thing]], such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details. URL sameAs URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website. URL image An image of the item. This can be a [[URL]] or a fully described [[ImageObject]]. URL name The name of the item. Text subjectOf A CreativeWork or Event about this Thing. Event disambiguatingDescription A sub property of description.

InteractionCounter headline Headline of the article. Text sdLicense A license document that applies to this structured data, typically indicated by URL. URL acquireLicensePage Indicates a page documenting how licenses can be purchased or otherwise acquired, for the current item. URL review A review of the item. Review creditText Text that can be used to credit person(s) and/or organization(s) associated with a published Creative Work. Text associatedMedia A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for encoding. MediaObject schemaVersion Indicates (by URL or string) a particular version of a schema used in some CreativeWork. This property was created primarily to indicate the use of a specific schema.org release, e.g. 10.0 as a simple string, or more explicitly via URL, https://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v10.0 . There may be situations in which other schemas might usefully be referenced this way, e.g. http://dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dces/1999-07-02/ but this has not been carefully explored in the community. URL digitalSourceType Indicates an IPTCDigitalSourceEnumeration code indicating the nature of the digital source(s) for some [[CreativeWork]].

In the case of products, the country of origin of the product. The exact interpretation of this may vary by context and product type, and cannot be fully enumerated here. Country encodings A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. MediaObject locationCreated The location where the CreativeWork was created, which may not be the same as the location depicted in the CreativeWork. Place maintainer A maintainer of a [[Dataset]], software package ([[SoftwareApplication]]), or other [[Project]]. A maintainer is a [[Person]] or [[Organization]] that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on \"upstream\" sources. When [[maintainer]] is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a [[Dataset]], it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The [[isBasedOn]] property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work. Person inLanguage The language of the content or performance or used in an action. Please use one of the language codes from the IETF BCP 47 standard . See also [[availableLanguage]]. Text assesses The item being described is intended to assess the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term.

Number dateCreated The date on which the CreativeWork was created or the item was added to a DataFeed. DateTime position The position of an item in a series or sequence of items. Text educationalLevel The level in terms of progression through an educational or training context. Examples of educational levels include 'beginner', 'intermediate' or 'advanced', and formal sets of level indicators. URL temporalCoverage The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format . In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written \"2011/2012\"). Other forms of content, e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode, may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via \"1939/1945\". Open-ended date ranges can be written with \"..\" in place of the end date. For example, \"2015-11/..\" indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. URL typicalAgeRange The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'. Text publisher The publisher of the creative work. Person sdPublisher Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site. For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing content with more explicitly structured metadata. The [[sdPublisher]] property helps make such practices more explicit. Person workExample Example/instance/realization/derivation of the concept of this creative work.

Text usageInfo The schema.org [[usageInfo]] property indicates further information about a [[CreativeWork]]. This property is applicable both to works that are freely available and to those that require payment or other transactions. It can reference additional information, e.g. community expectations on preferred linking and citation conventions, as well as purchasing details. For something that can be commercially licensed, usageInfo can provide detailed, resource-specific information about licensing options. This property can be used alongside the license property which indicates license(s) applicable to some piece of content. The usageInfo property can provide information about other licensing options, e.g. acquiring commercial usage rights for an image that is also available under non-commercial creative commons licenses.

This property is a synonym for encoding. MediaObject schemaVersion Indicates (by URL or string) a particular version of a schema used in some CreativeWork. This property was created primarily to indicate the use of a specific schema.org release, e.g. 10.0 as a simple string, or more explicitly via URL, https://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v10.0 . There may be situations in which other schemas might usefully be referenced this way, e.g. http://dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dces/1999-07-02/ but this has not been carefully explored in the community. URL digitalSourceType Indicates an IPTCDigitalSourceEnumeration code indicating the nature of the digital source(s) for some [[CreativeWork]].

Values should be drawn from the approved vocabulary . Text about The subject matter of the content. Thing countryOfOrigin The country of origin of something, including products as well as creative works such as movie and TV content. In the case of TV and movie, this would be the country of the principle offices of the production company or individual responsible for the movie. For other kinds of [[CreativeWork]] it is difficult to provide fully general guidance, and properties such as [[contentLocation]] and [[locationCreated]] may be more applicable. In the case of products, the country of origin of the product. The exact interpretation of this may vary by context and product type, and cannot be fully enumerated here. Country encodings A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. MediaObject locationCreated The location where the CreativeWork was created, which may not be the same as the location depicted in the CreativeWork. Place maintainer A maintainer of a [[Dataset]], software package ([[SoftwareApplication]]), or other [[Project]]. A maintainer is a [[Person]] or [[Organization]] that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on \"upstream\" sources. When [[maintainer]] is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a [[Dataset]], it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The [[isBasedOn]] property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work. Person inLanguage The language of the content or performance or used in an action. Please use one of the language codes from the IETF BCP 47 standard . See also [[availableLanguage]]. Text assesses The item being described is intended to assess the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. Text editEIDR An EIDR (Entertainment Identifier Registry) [[identifier]] representing a specific edit / edition for a work of film or television. For example, the motion picture known as \"Ghostbusters\" whose [[titleEIDR]] is \"10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J\" has several edits, e.g. \"10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I\" and \"10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3\". Since schema.org types like [[Movie]] and [[TVEpisode]] can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use [[titleEIDR]] alone (for a general description), or alongside [[editEIDR]] for a more edit-specific description. URL pattern A pattern that something has, for example 'polka dot', 'striped', 'Canadian flag'. Values are typically expressed as text, although links to controlled value schemes are also supported. Text citation A citation or reference to another creative work, such as another publication, web page, scholarly article, etc. Text encoding A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for associatedMedia. MediaObject accessibilitySummary A human-readable summary of specific accessibility features or deficiencies, consistent with the other accessibility metadata but expressing subtleties such as \"short descriptions are present but long descriptions will be needed for non-visual users\" or \"short descriptions are present and no long descriptions are needed\".

E.g. \u897f\u904a\u8a18 has an English workTranslation \u201cJourney to the West\u201d, a German workTranslation \u201cMonkeys Pilgerfahrt\u201d and a Vietnamese translation T\u00e2y du k\u00fd b\u00ecnh kh\u1ea3o. CreativeWork releasedEvent The place and time the release was issued, expressed as a PublicationEvent. PublicationEvent commentCount The number of comments this CreativeWork (e.g. Article, Question or Answer) has received. This is most applicable to works published in Web sites with commenting system; additional comments may exist elsewhere. Integer copyrightNotice Text of a notice appropriate for describing the copyright aspects of this Creative Work, ideally indicating the owner of the copyright for the Work. Text educationalAlignment An alignment to an established educational framework. This property should not be used where the nature of the alignment can be described using a simple property, for example to express that a resource [[teaches]] or [[assesses]] a competency. AlignmentObject author The author of this content or rating. Please note that author is special in that HTML 5 provides a special mechanism for indicating authorship via the rel tag. That is equivalent to this and may be used interchangeably. Person exampleOfWork A creative work that this work is an example/instance/realization/derivation of. CreativeWork temporal The \"temporal\" property can be used in cases where more specific properties (e.g. [[temporalCoverage]], [[dateCreated]], [[dateModified]], [[datePublished]]) are not known to be appropriate. Text keywords Keywords or tags used to describe some item. Multiple textual entries in a keywords list are typically delimited by commas, or by repeating the property. URL accountablePerson Specifies the Person that is legally accountable for the CreativeWork. Person archivedAt Indicates a page or other link involved in archival of a [[CreativeWork]]. In the case of [[MediaReview]], the items in a [[MediaReviewItem]] may often become inaccessible, but be archived by archival, journalistic, activist, or law enforcement organizations. In such cases, the referenced page may not directly publish the content. WebPage correction Indicates a correction to a [[CreativeWork]], either via a [[CorrectionComment]], textually or in another document. URL funder A person or organization that supports (sponsors) something through some kind of financial contribution. Person provider The service provider, service operator, or service performer; the goods producer. Another party (a seller) may offer those services or goods on behalf of the provider. A provider may also serve as the seller. Person interactivityType The predominant mode of learning supported by the learning resource. Acceptable values are 'active', 'expositive', or 'mixed'. Text material A material that something is made from, e.g. leather, wool, cotton, paper. URL offers An offer to provide this item\u2014for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use [[businessFunction]] to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a [[Demand]]. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer. Offer copyrightHolder The party holding the legal copyright to the CreativeWork. Person editor Specifies the Person who edited the CreativeWork. Person materialExtent The quantity of the materials being described or an expression of the physical space they occupy. Text fileFormat Media type, typically MIME format (see IANA site ) of the content, e.g. application/zip of a SoftwareApplication binary. In cases where a CreativeWork has several media type representations, 'encoding' can be used to indicate each MediaObject alongside particular fileFormat information. Unregistered or niche file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia entry. URL genre Genre of the creative work, broadcast channel or group. URL reviews Review of the item. Review publishingPrinciples The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via [[URL]]) a document describing the editorial principles of an [[Organization]] (or individual, e.g. a [[Person]] writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a [[CreativeWork]] (e.g. [[NewsArticle]]) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the [[CreativeWork]]. While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a [[funder]]) can be expressed using schema.org terminology. URL accessibilityFeature Content features of the resource, such as accessible media, alternatives and supported enhancements for accessibility. Values should be drawn from the approved vocabulary . Text spatialCoverage The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York. Place sdDatePublished Indicates the date on which the current structured data was generated / published. Typically used alongside [[sdPublisher]]. Date conditionsOfAccess Conditions that affect the availability of, or method(s) of access to, an item. Typically used for real world items such as an [[ArchiveComponent]] held by an [[ArchiveOrganization]]. This property is not suitable for use as a general Web access control mechanism.

URL temporalCoverage The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format . In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written \"2011/2012\"). Other forms of content, e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode, may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via \"1939/1945\". Open-ended date ranges can be written with \"..\" in place of the end date. For example, \"2015-11/..\" indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. URL typicalAgeRange The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'. Text publisher The publisher of the creative work. Person sdPublisher Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site.

URL digitalSourceType Indicates an IPTCDigitalSourceEnumeration code indicating the nature of the digital source(s) for some [[CreativeWork]]. IPTCDigitalSourceEnumeration producer The person or organization who produced the work (e.g. music album, movie, TV/radio series etc.). Person contributor A secondary contributor to the CreativeWork or Event. Person isAccessibleForFree A flag to signal that the item, event, or place is accessible for free. Boolean accessibilityHazard A characteristic of the described resource that is physiologically dangerous to some users. Related to WCAG 2.0 guideline 2.3. Values should be drawn from the approved vocabulary . Text about The subject matter of the content. Thing countryOfOrigin The country of origin of something, including products as well as creative works such as movie and TV content. In the case of TV and movie, this would be the country of the principle offices of the production company or individual responsible for the movie. For other kinds of [[CreativeWork]] it is difficult to provide fully general guidance, and properties such as [[contentLocation]] and [[locationCreated]] may be more applicable. In the case of products, the country of origin of the product. The exact interpretation of this may vary by context and product type, and cannot be fully enumerated here. Country encodings A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. MediaObject locationCreated The location where the CreativeWork was created, which may not be the same as the location depicted in the CreativeWork. Place maintainer A maintainer of a [[Dataset]], software package ([[SoftwareApplication]]), or other [[Project]]. A maintainer is a [[Person]] or [[Organization]] that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on \"upstream\" sources. When [[maintainer]] is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a [[Dataset]], it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The [[isBasedOn]] property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work. Person inLanguage The language of the content or performance or used in an action. Please use one of the language codes from the IETF BCP 47 standard . See also [[availableLanguage]]. Text assesses The item being described is intended to assess the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. Text editEIDR An EIDR (Entertainment Identifier Registry) [[identifier]] representing a specific edit / edition for a work of film or television. For example, the motion picture known as \"Ghostbusters\" whose [[titleEIDR]] is \"10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J\" has several edits, e.g. \"10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I\" and \"10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3\". Since schema.org types like [[Movie]] and [[TVEpisode]] can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use [[titleEIDR]] alone (for a general description), or alongside [[editEIDR]] for a more edit-specific description. URL pattern A pattern that something has, for example 'polka dot', 'striped', 'Canadian flag'. Values are typically expressed as text, although links to controlled value schemes are also supported. Text citation A citation or reference to another creative work, such as another publication, web page, scholarly article, etc. Text encoding A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for associatedMedia. MediaObject accessibilitySummary A human-readable summary of specific accessibility features or deficiencies, consistent with the other accessibility metadata but expressing subtleties such as \"short descriptions are present but long descriptions will be needed for non-visual users\" or \"short descriptions are present and no long descriptions are needed\".

CreativeWork releasedEvent The place and time the release was issued, expressed as a PublicationEvent. PublicationEvent commentCount The number of comments this CreativeWork (e.g. Article, Question or Answer) has received. This is most applicable to works published in Web sites with commenting system; additional comments may exist elsewhere. Integer copyrightNotice Text of a notice appropriate for describing the copyright aspects of this Creative Work, ideally indicating the owner of the copyright for the Work. Text educationalAlignment An alignment to an established educational framework. This property should not be used where the nature of the alignment can be described using a simple property, for example to express that a resource [[teaches]] or [[assesses]] a competency. AlignmentObject author The author of this content or rating. Please note that author is special in that HTML 5 provides a special mechanism for indicating authorship via the rel tag. That is equivalent to this and may be used interchangeably. Person exampleOfWork A creative work that this work is an example/instance/realization/derivation of. CreativeWork temporal The \"temporal\" property can be used in cases where more specific properties (e.g. [[temporalCoverage]], [[dateCreated]], [[dateModified]], [[datePublished]]) are not known to be appropriate. Text keywords Keywords or tags used to describe some item. Multiple textual entries in a keywords list are typically delimited by commas, or by repeating the property. URL accountablePerson Specifies the Person that is legally accountable for the CreativeWork. Person archivedAt Indicates a page or other link involved in archival of a [[CreativeWork]]. In the case of [[MediaReview]], the items in a [[MediaReviewItem]] may often become inaccessible, but be archived by archival, journalistic, activist, or law enforcement organizations. In such cases, the referenced page may not directly publish the content. WebPage correction Indicates a correction to a [[CreativeWork]], either via a [[CorrectionComment]], textually or in another document. URL funder A person or organization that supports (sponsors) something through some kind of financial contribution.

Use [[businessFunction]] to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a [[Demand]]. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer. Offer copyrightHolder The party holding the legal copyright to the CreativeWork. Person editor Specifies the Person who edited the CreativeWork. Person materialExtent The quantity of the materials being described or an expression of the physical space they occupy. Text fileFormat Media type, typically MIME format (see IANA site ) of the content, e.g. application/zip of a SoftwareApplication binary. In cases where a CreativeWork has several media type representations, 'encoding' can be used to indicate each MediaObject alongside particular fileFormat information. Unregistered or niche file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia entry. URL genre Genre of the creative work, broadcast channel or group. URL reviews Review of the item. Review publishingPrinciples The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via [[URL]]) a document describing the editorial principles of an [[Organization]] (or individual, e.g. a [[Person]] writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a [[CreativeWork]] (e.g. [[NewsArticle]]) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the [[CreativeWork]]. While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a [[funder]]) can be expressed using schema.org terminology. URL accessibilityFeature Content features of the resource, such as accessible media, alternatives and supported enhancements for accessibility. Values should be drawn from the approved vocabulary . Text spatialCoverage The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York. Place sdDatePublished Indicates the date on which the current structured data was generated / published. Typically used alongside [[sdPublisher]]. Date conditionsOfAccess Conditions that affect the availability of, or method(s) of access to, an item. Typically used for real world items such as an [[ArchiveComponent]] held by an [[ArchiveOrganization]]. This property is not suitable for use as a general Web access control mechanism. It is expressed only in natural language.\\n\\nFor example \"Available by appointment from the Reading Room\" or \"Accessible only from logged-in accounts \". Text thumbnail Thumbnail image for an image or video. ImageObject sponsor A person or organization that supports a thing through a pledge, promise, or financial contribution. E.g. a sponsor of a Medical Study or a corporate sponsor of an event. Person isPartOf Indicates an item or CreativeWork that this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense), is part of. URL copyrightYear The year during which the claimed copyright for the CreativeWork was first asserted. Number dateCreated The date on which the CreativeWork was created or the item was added to a DataFeed. DateTime position The position of an item in a series or sequence of items. Text educationalLevel The level in terms of progression through an educational or training context. Examples of educational levels include 'beginner', 'intermediate' or 'advanced', and formal sets of level indicators. URL temporalCoverage The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format . In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written \"2011/2012\"). Other forms of content, e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode, may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via \"1939/1945\". Open-ended date ranges can be written with \"..\" in place of the end date. For example, \"2015-11/..\" indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. URL typicalAgeRange The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'. Text publisher The publisher of the creative work. Person sdPublisher Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site. For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing content with more explicitly structured metadata. The [[sdPublisher]] property helps make such practices more explicit. Person workExample Example/instance/realization/derivation of the concept of this creative work.

Text usageInfo The schema.org [[usageInfo]] property indicates further information about a [[CreativeWork]]. This property is applicable both to works that are freely available and to those that require payment or other transactions. It can reference additional information, e.g. community expectations on preferred linking and citation conventions, as well as purchasing details. For something that can be commercially licensed, usageInfo can provide detailed, resource-specific information about licensing options. This property can be used alongside the license property which indicates license(s) applicable to some piece of content. The usageInfo property can provide information about other licensing options, e.g. acquiring commercial usage rights for an image that is also available under non-commercial creative commons licenses. URL audio An embedded audio object. MusicRecording comment Comments, typically from users. Comment award An award won by or for this item. Text alternativeHeadline A secondary title of the CreativeWork. Text expires Date the content expires and is no longer useful or available.

Place url URL of the item. URL mainEntityOfPage Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See background notes for details. URL potentialAction Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. Action description A description of the item. TextObject additionalType An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide . URL identifier The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of [[Thing]], such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links.

MediaObject locationCreated The location where the CreativeWork was created, which may not be the same as the location depicted in the CreativeWork. Place maintainer A maintainer of a [[Dataset]], software package ([[SoftwareApplication]]), or other [[Project]]. A maintainer is a [[Person]] or [[Organization]] that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on \"upstream\" sources. When [[maintainer]] is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a [[Dataset]], it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The [[isBasedOn]] property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work.

Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via \"1939/1945\". Open-ended date ranges can be written with \"..\" in place of the end date. For example, \"2015-11/..\" indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. URL typicalAgeRange The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'. Text publisher The publisher of the creative work. Person sdPublisher Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site. For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing content with more explicitly structured metadata. The [[sdPublisher]] property helps make such practices more explicit. Person workExample Example/instance/realization/derivation of the concept of this creative work. E.g. the paperback edition, first edition, or e-book. CreativeWork video An embedded video object.

This property is applicable both to works that are freely available and to those that require payment or other transactions. It can reference additional information, e.g. community expectations on preferred linking and citation conventions, as well as purchasing details. For something that can be commercially licensed, usageInfo can provide detailed, resource-specific information about licensing options. This property can be used alongside the license property which indicates license(s) applicable to some piece of content. The usageInfo property can provide information about other licensing options, e.g. acquiring commercial usage rights for an image that is also available under non-commercial creative commons licenses. URL audio An embedded audio object. MusicRecording comment Comments, typically from users. Comment award An award won by or for this item.

Review creditText Text that can be used to credit person(s) and/or organization(s) associated with a published Creative Work. Text associatedMedia A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for encoding. MediaObject schemaVersion Indicates (by URL or string) a particular version of a schema used in some CreativeWork. This property was created primarily to indicate the use of a specific schema.org release, e.g. 10.0 as a simple string, or more explicitly via URL, https://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v10.0 . There may be situations in which other schemas might usefully be referenced this way, e.g. http://dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dces/1999-07-02/ but this has not been carefully explored in the community. URL digitalSourceType Indicates an IPTCDigitalSourceEnumeration code indicating the nature of the digital source(s) for some [[CreativeWork]].

Boolean accessibilityHazard A characteristic of the described resource that is physiologically dangerous to some users. Related to WCAG 2.0 guideline 2.3. Values should be drawn from the approved vocabulary . Text about The subject matter of the content. Thing countryOfOrigin The country of origin of something, including products as well as creative works such as movie and TV content. In the case of TV and movie, this would be the country of the principle offices of the production company or individual responsible for the movie. For other kinds of [[CreativeWork]] it is difficult to provide fully general guidance, and properties such as [[contentLocation]] and [[locationCreated]] may be more applicable. In the case of products, the country of origin of the product. The exact interpretation of this may vary by context and product type, and cannot be fully enumerated here. Country encodings A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. MediaObject locationCreated The location where the CreativeWork was created, which may not be the same as the location depicted in the CreativeWork. Place maintainer A maintainer of a [[Dataset]], software package ([[SoftwareApplication]]), or other [[Project]]. A maintainer is a [[Person]] or [[Organization]] that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on \"upstream\" sources. When [[maintainer]] is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a [[Dataset]], it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The [[isBasedOn]] property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work. Person inLanguage The language of the content or performance or used in an action. Please use one of the language codes from the IETF BCP 47 standard . See also [[availableLanguage]]. Text assesses The item being described is intended to assess the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. Text editEIDR An EIDR (Entertainment Identifier Registry) [[identifier]] representing a specific edit / edition for a work of film or television. For example, the motion picture known as \"Ghostbusters\" whose [[titleEIDR]] is \"10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J\" has several edits, e.g. \"10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I\" and \"10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3\". Since schema.org types like [[Movie]] and [[TVEpisode]] can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use [[titleEIDR]] alone (for a general description), or alongside [[editEIDR]] for a more edit-specific description. URL pattern A pattern that something has, for example 'polka dot', 'striped', 'Canadian flag'. Values are typically expressed as text, although links to controlled value schemes are also supported. Text citation A citation or reference to another creative work, such as another publication, web page, scholarly article, etc. Text encoding A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for associatedMedia. MediaObject accessibilitySummary A human-readable summary of specific accessibility features or deficiencies, consistent with the other accessibility metadata but expressing subtleties such as \"short descriptions are present but long descriptions will be needed for non-visual users\" or \"short descriptions are present and no long descriptions are needed\". Text isBasedOn A resource from which this work is derived or from which it is a modification or adaptation. URL teaches The item being described is intended to help a person learn the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. Text accessibilityAPI Indicates that the resource is compatible with the referenced accessibility API. Values should be drawn from the approved vocabulary .

Text size A standardized size of a product or creative work, specified either through a simple textual string (for example 'XL', '32Wx34L'), a QuantitativeValue with a unitCode, or a comprehensive and structured [[SizeSpecification]]; in other cases, the [[width]], [[height]], [[depth]] and [[weight]] properties may be more applicable. Text isBasedOnUrl A resource that was used in the creation of this resource. This term can be repeated for multiple sources. For example, http://example.com/great-multiplication-intro.html. URL contentRating Official rating of a piece of content\u2014for example, 'MPAA PG-13'. Text aggregateRating The overall rating, based on a collection of reviews or ratings, of the item. AggregateRating creator The creator/author of this CreativeWork. This is the same as the Author property for CreativeWork. Person publication A publication event associated with the item. PublicationEvent workTranslation A work that is a translation of the content of this work. E.g. \u897f\u904a\u8a18 has an English workTranslation \u201cJourney to the West\u201d, a German workTranslation \u201cMonkeys Pilgerfahrt\u201d and a Vietnamese translation T\u00e2y du k\u00fd b\u00ecnh kh\u1ea3o. CreativeWork releasedEvent The place and time the release was issued, expressed as a PublicationEvent. PublicationEvent commentCount The number of comments this CreativeWork (e.g. Article, Question or Answer) has received. This is most applicable to works published in Web sites with commenting system; additional comments may exist elsewhere. Integer copyrightNotice Text of a notice appropriate for describing the copyright aspects of this Creative Work, ideally indicating the owner of the copyright for the Work. Text educationalAlignment An alignment to an established educational framework. This property should not be used where the nature of the alignment can be described using a simple property, for example to express that a resource [[teaches]] or [[assesses]] a competency. AlignmentObject author The author of this content or rating. Please note that author is special in that HTML 5 provides a special mechanism for indicating authorship via the rel tag. That is equivalent to this and may be used interchangeably. Person exampleOfWork A creative work that this work is an example/instance/realization/derivation of. CreativeWork temporal The \"temporal\" property can be used in cases where more specific properties (e.g. [[temporalCoverage]], [[dateCreated]], [[dateModified]], [[datePublished]]) are not known to be appropriate. Text keywords Keywords or tags used to describe some item. Multiple textual entries in a keywords list are typically delimited by commas, or by repeating the property. URL accountablePerson Specifies the Person that is legally accountable for the CreativeWork. Person archivedAt Indicates a page or other link involved in archival of a [[CreativeWork]]. In the case of [[MediaReview]], the items in a [[MediaReviewItem]] may often become inaccessible, but be archived by archival, journalistic, activist, or law enforcement organizations. In such cases, the referenced page may not directly publish the content. WebPage correction Indicates a correction to a [[CreativeWork]], either via a [[CorrectionComment]], textually or in another document. URL funder A person or organization that supports (sponsors) something through some kind of financial contribution. Person provider The service provider, service operator, or service performer; the goods producer. Another party (a seller) may offer those services or goods on behalf of the provider. A provider may also serve as the seller. Person interactivityType The predominant mode of learning supported by the learning resource. Acceptable values are 'active', 'expositive', or 'mixed'. Text material A material that something is made from, e.g. leather, wool, cotton, paper. URL offers An offer to provide this item\u2014for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use [[businessFunction]] to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a [[Demand]]. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer. Offer copyrightHolder The party holding the legal copyright to the CreativeWork. Person editor Specifies the Person who edited the CreativeWork. Person materialExtent The quantity of the materials being described or an expression of the physical space they occupy. Text fileFormat Media type, typically MIME format (see IANA site ) of the content, e.g. application/zip of a SoftwareApplication binary. In cases where a CreativeWork has several media type representations, 'encoding' can be used to indicate each MediaObject alongside particular fileFormat information. Unregistered or niche file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia entry. URL genre Genre of the creative work, broadcast channel or group. URL reviews Review of the item. Review publishingPrinciples The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via [[URL]]) a document describing the editorial principles of an [[Organization]] (or individual, e.g. a [[Person]] writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a [[CreativeWork]] (e.g. [[NewsArticle]]) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the [[CreativeWork]]. While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a [[funder]]) can be expressed using schema.org terminology. URL accessibilityFeature Content features of the resource, such as accessible media, alternatives and supported enhancements for accessibility. Values should be drawn from the approved vocabulary . Text spatialCoverage The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York. Place sdDatePublished Indicates the date on which the current structured data was generated / published. Typically used alongside [[sdPublisher]]. Date conditionsOfAccess Conditions that affect the availability of, or method(s) of access to, an item. Typically used for real world items such as an [[ArchiveComponent]] held by an [[ArchiveOrganization]]. This property is not suitable for use as a general Web access control mechanism. It is expressed only in natural language.\\n\\nFor example \"Available by appointment from the Reading Room\" or \"Accessible only from logged-in accounts \". Text thumbnail Thumbnail image for an image or video. ImageObject sponsor A person or organization that supports a thing through a pledge, promise, or financial contribution.

Number dateCreated The date on which the CreativeWork was created or the item was added to a DataFeed. DateTime position The position of an item in a series or sequence of items. Text educationalLevel The level in terms of progression through an educational or training context. Examples of educational levels include 'beginner', 'intermediate' or 'advanced', and formal sets of level indicators. URL temporalCoverage The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format . In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written \"2011/2012\"). Other forms of content, e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode, may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via \"1939/1945\". Open-ended date ranges can be written with \"..\" in place of the end date. For example, \"2015-11/..\" indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. URL typicalAgeRange The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'. Text publisher The publisher of the creative work. Person sdPublisher Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site.

Place maintainer A maintainer of a [[Dataset]], software package ([[SoftwareApplication]]), or other [[Project]]. A maintainer is a [[Person]] or [[Organization]] that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on \"upstream\" sources. When [[maintainer]] is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a [[Dataset]], it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The [[isBasedOn]] property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work. Person inLanguage The language of the content or performance or used in an action. Please use one of the language codes from the IETF BCP 47 standard . See also [[availableLanguage]]. Text assesses The item being described is intended to assess the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. Text editEIDR An EIDR (Entertainment Identifier Registry) [[identifier]] representing a specific edit / edition for a work of film or television. For example, the motion picture known as \"Ghostbusters\" whose [[titleEIDR]] is \"10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J\" has several edits, e.g. \"10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I\" and \"10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3\". Since schema.org types like [[Movie]] and [[TVEpisode]] can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use [[titleEIDR]] alone (for a general description), or alongside [[editEIDR]] for a more edit-specific description. URL pattern A pattern that something has, for example 'polka dot', 'striped', 'Canadian flag'. Values are typically expressed as text, although links to controlled value schemes are also supported. Text citation A citation or reference to another creative work, such as another publication, web page, scholarly article, etc. Text encoding A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for associatedMedia.

This is most applicable to works published in Web sites with commenting system; additional comments may exist elsewhere. Integer copyrightNotice Text of a notice appropriate for describing the copyright aspects of this Creative Work, ideally indicating the owner of the copyright for the Work. Text educationalAlignment An alignment to an established educational framework. This property should not be used where the nature of the alignment can be described using a simple property, for example to express that a resource [[teaches]] or [[assesses]] a competency. AlignmentObject author The author of this content or rating. Please note that author is special in that HTML 5 provides a special mechanism for indicating authorship via the rel tag. That is equivalent to this and may be used interchangeably. Person exampleOfWork A creative work that this work is an example/instance/realization/derivation of. CreativeWork temporal The \"temporal\" property can be used in cases where more specific properties (e.g. [[temporalCoverage]], [[dateCreated]], [[dateModified]], [[datePublished]]) are not known to be appropriate.

Use [[businessFunction]] to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a [[Demand]]. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer. Offer copyrightHolder The party holding the legal copyright to the CreativeWork. Person editor Specifies the Person who edited the CreativeWork. Person materialExtent The quantity of the materials being described or an expression of the physical space they occupy. Text fileFormat Media type, typically MIME format (see IANA site ) of the content, e.g. application/zip of a SoftwareApplication binary.

Unregistered or niche file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia entry. URL genre Genre of the creative work, broadcast channel or group. URL reviews Review of the item. Review publishingPrinciples The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via [[URL]]) a document describing the editorial principles of an [[Organization]] (or individual, e.g. a [[Person]] writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a [[CreativeWork]] (e.g. [[NewsArticle]]) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the [[CreativeWork]]. While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a [[funder]]) can be expressed using schema.org terminology. URL accessibilityFeature Content features of the resource, such as accessible media, alternatives and supported enhancements for accessibility. Values should be drawn from the approved vocabulary . Text spatialCoverage The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York. Place sdDatePublished Indicates the date on which the current structured data was generated / published. Typically used alongside [[sdPublisher]]. Date conditionsOfAccess Conditions that affect the availability of, or method(s) of access to, an item. Typically used for real world items such as an [[ArchiveComponent]] held by an [[ArchiveOrganization]]. This property is not suitable for use as a general Web access control mechanism. It is expressed only in natural language.\\n\\nFor example \"Available by appointment from the Reading Room\" or \"Accessible only from logged-in accounts \".

URL temporalCoverage The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format . In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written \"2011/2012\"). Other forms of content, e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode, may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via \"1939/1945\". Open-ended date ranges can be written with \"..\" in place of the end date. For example, \"2015-11/..\" indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. URL typicalAgeRange The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'. Text publisher The publisher of the creative work.

URL potentialAction Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. Action description A description of the item. TextObject additionalType An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide . URL identifier The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of [[Thing]], such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links.

Grant learningResourceType The predominant type or kind characterizing the learning resource. For example, 'presentation', 'handout'. Text usageInfo The schema.org [[usageInfo]] property indicates further information about a [[CreativeWork]]. This property is applicable both to works that are freely available and to those that require payment or other transactions. It can reference additional information, e.g. community expectations on preferred linking and citation conventions, as well as purchasing details. For something that can be commercially licensed, usageInfo can provide detailed, resource-specific information about licensing options. This property can be used alongside the license property which indicates license(s) applicable to some piece of content. The usageInfo property can provide information about other licensing options, e.g. acquiring commercial usage rights for an image that is also available under non-commercial creative commons licenses. URL audio An embedded audio object. MusicRecording comment Comments, typically from users. Comment award An award won by or for this item. Text alternativeHeadline A secondary title of the CreativeWork. Text expires Date the content expires and is no longer useful or available.

Place url URL of the item. URL mainEntityOfPage Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See background notes for details. URL potentialAction Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. Action description A description of the item. TextObject additionalType An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide . URL identifier The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of [[Thing]], such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links.

InteractionCounter headline Headline of the article. Text sdLicense A license document that applies to this structured data, typically indicated by URL. URL acquireLicensePage Indicates a page documenting how licenses can be purchased or otherwise acquired, for the current item. URL review A review of the item. Review creditText Text that can be used to credit person(s) and/or organization(s) associated with a published Creative Work. Text associatedMedia A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for encoding. MediaObject schemaVersion Indicates (by URL or string) a particular version of a schema used in some CreativeWork. This property was created primarily to indicate the use of a specific schema.org release, e.g. 10.0 as a simple string, or more explicitly via URL, https://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v10.0 . There may be situations in which other schemas might usefully be referenced this way, e.g. http://dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dces/1999-07-02/ but this has not been carefully explored in the community. URL digitalSourceType Indicates an IPTCDigitalSourceEnumeration code indicating the nature of the digital source(s) for some [[CreativeWork]]. IPTCDigitalSourceEnumeration producer The person or organization who produced the work (e.g. music album, movie, TV/radio series etc.).

Boolean accessibilityHazard A characteristic of the described resource that is physiologically dangerous to some users. Related to WCAG 2.0 guideline 2.3. Values should be drawn from the approved vocabulary . Text about The subject matter of the content. Thing countryOfOrigin The country of origin of something, including products as well as creative works such as movie and TV content. In the case of TV and movie, this would be the country of the principle offices of the production company or individual responsible for the movie. For other kinds of [[CreativeWork]] it is difficult to provide fully general guidance, and properties such as [[contentLocation]] and [[locationCreated]] may be more applicable. In the case of products, the country of origin of the product. The exact interpretation of this may vary by context and product type, and cannot be fully enumerated here. Country encodings A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. MediaObject locationCreated The location where the CreativeWork was created, which may not be the same as the location depicted in the CreativeWork. Place maintainer A maintainer of a [[Dataset]], software package ([[SoftwareApplication]]), or other [[Project]]. A maintainer is a [[Person]] or [[Organization]] that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on \"upstream\" sources. When [[maintainer]] is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a [[Dataset]], it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The [[isBasedOn]] property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work. Person inLanguage The language of the content or performance or used in an action. Please use one of the language codes from the IETF BCP 47 standard . See also [[availableLanguage]]. Text assesses The item being described is intended to assess the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. Text editEIDR An EIDR (Entertainment Identifier Registry) [[identifier]] representing a specific edit / edition for a work of film or television. For example, the motion picture known as \"Ghostbusters\" whose [[titleEIDR]] is \"10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J\" has several edits, e.g. \"10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I\" and \"10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3\". Since schema.org types like [[Movie]] and [[TVEpisode]] can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use [[titleEIDR]] alone (for a general description), or alongside [[editEIDR]] for a more edit-specific description. URL pattern A pattern that something has, for example 'polka dot', 'striped', 'Canadian flag'. Values are typically expressed as text, although links to controlled value schemes are also supported. Text citation A citation or reference to another creative work, such as another publication, web page, scholarly article, etc. Text encoding A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for associatedMedia. MediaObject accessibilitySummary A human-readable summary of specific accessibility features or deficiencies, consistent with the other accessibility metadata but expressing subtleties such as \"short descriptions are present but long descriptions will be needed for non-visual users\" or \"short descriptions are present and no long descriptions are needed\".

Text size A standardized size of a product or creative work, specified either through a simple textual string (for example 'XL', '32Wx34L'), a QuantitativeValue with a unitCode, or a comprehensive and structured [[SizeSpecification]]; in other cases, the [[width]], [[height]], [[depth]] and [[weight]] properties may be more applicable. Text isBasedOnUrl A resource that was used in the creation of this resource. This term can be repeated for multiple sources. For example, http://example.com/great-multiplication-intro.html. URL contentRating Official rating of a piece of content\u2014for example, 'MPAA PG-13'. Text aggregateRating The overall rating, based on a collection of reviews or ratings, of the item. AggregateRating creator The creator/author of this CreativeWork. This is the same as the Author property for CreativeWork. Person publication A publication event associated with the item.

E.g. \u897f\u904a\u8a18 has an English workTranslation \u201cJourney to the West\u201d, a German workTranslation \u201cMonkeys Pilgerfahrt\u201d and a Vietnamese translation T\u00e2y du k\u00fd b\u00ecnh kh\u1ea3o. CreativeWork releasedEvent The place and time the release was issued, expressed as a PublicationEvent. PublicationEvent commentCount The number of comments this CreativeWork (e.g. Article, Question or Answer) has received. This is most applicable to works published in Web sites with commenting system; additional comments may exist elsewhere. Integer copyrightNotice Text of a notice appropriate for describing the copyright aspects of this Creative Work, ideally indicating the owner of the copyright for the Work. Text educationalAlignment An alignment to an established educational framework. This property should not be used where the nature of the alignment can be described using a simple property, for example to express that a resource [[teaches]] or [[assesses]] a competency. AlignmentObject author The author of this content or rating. Please note that author is special in that HTML 5 provides a special mechanism for indicating authorship via the rel tag. That is equivalent to this and may be used interchangeably. Person exampleOfWork A creative work that this work is an example/instance/realization/derivation of. CreativeWork temporal The \"temporal\" property can be used in cases where more specific properties (e.g. [[temporalCoverage]], [[dateCreated]], [[dateModified]], [[datePublished]]) are not known to be appropriate. Text keywords Keywords or tags used to describe some item. Multiple textual entries in a keywords list are typically delimited by commas, or by repeating the property. URL accountablePerson Specifies the Person that is legally accountable for the CreativeWork. Person archivedAt Indicates a page or other link involved in archival of a [[CreativeWork]]. In the case of [[MediaReview]], the items in a [[MediaReviewItem]] may often become inaccessible, but be archived by archival, journalistic, activist, or law enforcement organizations. In such cases, the referenced page may not directly publish the content. WebPage correction Indicates a correction to a [[CreativeWork]], either via a [[CorrectionComment]], textually or in another document. URL funder A person or organization that supports (sponsors) something through some kind of financial contribution. Person provider The service provider, service operator, or service performer; the goods producer. Another party (a seller) may offer those services or goods on behalf of the provider. A provider may also serve as the seller. Person interactivityType The predominant mode of learning supported by the learning resource. Acceptable values are 'active', 'expositive', or 'mixed'. Text material A material that something is made from, e.g. leather, wool, cotton, paper. URL offers An offer to provide this item\u2014for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use [[businessFunction]] to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a [[Demand]]. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer. Offer copyrightHolder The party holding the legal copyright to the CreativeWork. Person editor Specifies the Person who edited the CreativeWork. Person materialExtent The quantity of the materials being described or an expression of the physical space they occupy. Text fileFormat Media type, typically MIME format (see IANA site ) of the content, e.g. application/zip of a SoftwareApplication binary. In cases where a CreativeWork has several media type representations, 'encoding' can be used to indicate each MediaObject alongside particular fileFormat information. Unregistered or niche file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia entry. URL genre Genre of the creative work, broadcast channel or group. URL reviews Review of the item. Review publishingPrinciples The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via [[URL]]) a document describing the editorial principles of an [[Organization]] (or individual, e.g. a [[Person]] writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a [[CreativeWork]] (e.g. [[NewsArticle]]) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the [[CreativeWork]]. While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a [[funder]]) can be expressed using schema.org terminology. URL accessibilityFeature Content features of the resource, such as accessible media, alternatives and supported enhancements for accessibility. Values should be drawn from the approved vocabulary . Text spatialCoverage The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York. Place sdDatePublished Indicates the date on which the current structured data was generated / published. Typically used alongside [[sdPublisher]]. Date conditionsOfAccess Conditions that affect the availability of, or method(s) of access to, an item. Typically used for real world items such as an [[ArchiveComponent]] held by an [[ArchiveOrganization]]. This property is not suitable for use as a general Web access control mechanism. It is expressed only in natural language.\\n\\nFor example \"Available by appointment from the Reading Room\" or \"Accessible only from logged-in accounts \". Text thumbnail Thumbnail image for an image or video. ImageObject sponsor A person or organization that supports a thing through a pledge, promise, or financial contribution. E.g. a sponsor of a Medical Study or a corporate sponsor of an event. Person isPartOf Indicates an item or CreativeWork that this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense), is part of. URL copyrightYear The year during which the claimed copyright for the CreativeWork was first asserted. Number dateCreated The date on which the CreativeWork was created or the item was added to a DataFeed. DateTime position The position of an item in a series or sequence of items. Text educationalLevel The level in terms of progression through an educational or training context. Examples of educational levels include 'beginner', 'intermediate' or 'advanced', and formal sets of level indicators. URL temporalCoverage The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format . In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written \"2011/2012\"). Other forms of content, e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode, may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via \"1939/1945\". Open-ended date ranges can be written with \"..\" in place of the end date. For example, \"2015-11/..\" indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. URL typicalAgeRange The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'. Text publisher The publisher of the creative work. Person sdPublisher Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site. For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing content with more explicitly structured metadata. The [[sdPublisher]] property helps make such practices more explicit. Person workExample Example/instance/realization/derivation of the concept of this creative work. E.g. the paperback edition, first edition, or e-book. CreativeWork video An embedded video object.

Grant learningResourceType The predominant type or kind characterizing the learning resource. For example, 'presentation', 'handout'. Text usageInfo The schema.org [[usageInfo]] property indicates further information about a [[CreativeWork]]. This property is applicable both to works that are freely available and to those that require payment or other transactions. It can reference additional information, e.g. community expectations on preferred linking and citation conventions, as well as purchasing details. For something that can be commercially licensed, usageInfo can provide detailed, resource-specific information about licensing options. This property can be used alongside the license property which indicates license(s) applicable to some piece of content. The usageInfo property can provide information about other licensing options, e.g. acquiring commercial usage rights for an image that is also available under non-commercial creative commons licenses. URL audio An embedded audio object. MusicRecording comment Comments, typically from users. Comment award An award won by or for this item. Text alternativeHeadline A secondary title of the CreativeWork. Text expires Date the content expires and is no longer useful or available. For example a [[VideoObject]] or [[NewsArticle]] whose availability or relevance is time-limited, a [[ClaimReview]] fact check whose publisher wants to indicate that it may no longer be relevant (or helpful to highlight) after some date, or a [[Certification]] the validity has expired.

Country encodings A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. MediaObject locationCreated The location where the CreativeWork was created, which may not be the same as the location depicted in the CreativeWork. Place maintainer A maintainer of a [[Dataset]], software package ([[SoftwareApplication]]), or other [[Project]]. A maintainer is a [[Person]] or [[Organization]] that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on \"upstream\" sources. When [[maintainer]] is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a [[Dataset]], it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The [[isBasedOn]] property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work. Person inLanguage The language of the content or performance or used in an action. Please use one of the language codes from the IETF BCP 47 standard . See also [[availableLanguage]]. Text assesses The item being described is intended to assess the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. Text editEIDR An EIDR (Entertainment Identifier Registry) [[identifier]] representing a specific edit / edition for a work of film or television. For example, the motion picture known as \"Ghostbusters\" whose [[titleEIDR]] is \"10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J\" has several edits, e.g. \"10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I\" and \"10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3\". Since schema.org types like [[Movie]] and [[TVEpisode]] can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use [[titleEIDR]] alone (for a general description), or alongside [[editEIDR]] for a more edit-specific description. URL pattern A pattern that something has, for example 'polka dot', 'striped', 'Canadian flag'. Values are typically expressed as text, although links to controlled value schemes are also supported. Text citation A citation or reference to another creative work, such as another publication, web page, scholarly article, etc. Text encoding A media object that encodes this CreativeWork.

In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written \"2011/2012\"). Other forms of content, e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode, may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via \"1939/1945\". Open-ended date ranges can be written with \"..\" in place of the end date. For example, \"2015-11/..\" indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date.

This property is a synonym for encoding. MediaObject schemaVersion Indicates (by URL or string) a particular version of a schema used in some CreativeWork. This property was created primarily to indicate the use of a specific schema.org release, e.g. 10.0 as a simple string, or more explicitly via URL, https://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v10.0 . There may be situations in which other schemas might usefully be referenced this way, e.g. http://dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dces/1999-07-02/ but this has not been carefully explored in the community.

Thing countryOfOrigin The country of origin of something, including products as well as creative works such as movie and TV content. In the case of TV and movie, this would be the country of the principle offices of the production company or individual responsible for the movie. For other kinds of [[CreativeWork]] it is difficult to provide fully general guidance, and properties such as [[contentLocation]] and [[locationCreated]] may be more applicable. In the case of products, the country of origin of the product. The exact interpretation of this may vary by context and product type, and cannot be fully enumerated here. Country encodings A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. MediaObject locationCreated The location where the CreativeWork was created, which may not be the same as the location depicted in the CreativeWork. Place maintainer A maintainer of a [[Dataset]], software package ([[SoftwareApplication]]), or other [[Project]]. A maintainer is a [[Person]] or [[Organization]] that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on \"upstream\" sources. When [[maintainer]] is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a [[Dataset]], it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The [[isBasedOn]] property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work. Person inLanguage The language of the content or performance or used in an action. Please use one of the language codes from the IETF BCP 47 standard . See also [[availableLanguage]]. Text assesses The item being described is intended to assess the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. Text editEIDR An EIDR (Entertainment Identifier Registry) [[identifier]] representing a specific edit / edition for a work of film or television. For example, the motion picture known as \"Ghostbusters\" whose [[titleEIDR]] is \"10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J\" has several edits, e.g. \"10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I\" and \"10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3\". Since schema.org types like [[Movie]] and [[TVEpisode]] can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use [[titleEIDR]] alone (for a general description), or alongside [[editEIDR]] for a more edit-specific description. URL pattern A pattern that something has, for example 'polka dot', 'striped', 'Canadian flag'. Values are typically expressed as text, although links to controlled value schemes are also supported. Text citation A citation or reference to another creative work, such as another publication, web page, scholarly article, etc. Text encoding A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for associatedMedia. MediaObject accessibilitySummary A human-readable summary of specific accessibility features or deficiencies, consistent with the other accessibility metadata but expressing subtleties such as \"short descriptions are present but long descriptions will be needed for non-visual users\" or \"short descriptions are present and no long descriptions are needed\".

It can reference additional information, e.g. community expectations on preferred linking and citation conventions, as well as purchasing details. For something that can be commercially licensed, usageInfo can provide detailed, resource-specific information about licensing options. This property can be used alongside the license property which indicates license(s) applicable to some piece of content. The usageInfo property can provide information about other licensing options, e.g. acquiring commercial usage rights for an image that is also available under non-commercial creative commons licenses. URL audio An embedded audio object. MusicRecording comment Comments, typically from users. Comment award An award won by or for this item. Text alternativeHeadline A secondary title of the CreativeWork. Text expires Date the content expires and is no longer useful or available. For example a [[VideoObject]] or [[NewsArticle]] whose availability or relevance is time-limited, a [[ClaimReview]] fact check whose publisher wants to indicate that it may no longer be relevant (or helpful to highlight) after some date, or a [[Certification]] the validity has expired.

Organization text The textual content of this CreativeWork. Text awards Awards won by or for this item. Text audience An intended audience, i.e. a group for whom something was created. Audience mainEntity Indicates the primary entity described in some page or other CreativeWork. Thing mentions Indicates that the CreativeWork contains a reference to, but is not necessarily about a concept. Thing accessMode The human sensory perceptual system or cognitive faculty through which a person may process or perceive information. Values should be drawn from the approved vocabulary . Text spatial The \"spatial\" property can be used in cases when more specific properties (e.g. [[locationCreated]], [[spatialCoverage]], [[contentLocation]]) are not known to be appropriate. Place url URL of the item. URL mainEntityOfPage Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See background notes for details. URL potentialAction Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role. Action description A description of the item. TextObject additionalType An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide . URL identifier The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of [[Thing]], such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details. URL sameAs URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website. URL image An image of the item. This can be a [[URL]] or a fully described [[ImageObject]].

For example the date a [[CreativeWork]] was broadcast or a [[Certification]] was issued. DateTime interactionStatistic The number of interactions for the CreativeWork using the WebSite or SoftwareApplication. The most specific child type of InteractionCounter should be used. InteractionCounter headline Headline of the article. Text sdLicense A license document that applies to this structured data, typically indicated by URL. URL acquireLicensePage Indicates a page documenting how licenses can be purchased or otherwise acquired, for the current item. URL review A review of the item. Review creditText Text that can be used to credit person(s) and/or organization(s) associated with a published Creative Work. Text associatedMedia A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for encoding. MediaObject schemaVersion Indicates (by URL or string) a particular version of a schema used in some CreativeWork. This property was created primarily to indicate the use of a specific schema.org release, e.g. 10.0 as a simple string, or more explicitly via URL, https://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v10.0 . There may be situations in which other schemas might usefully be referenced this way, e.g. http://dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dces/1999-07-02/ but this has not been carefully explored in the community. URL digitalSourceType Indicates an IPTCDigitalSourceEnumeration code indicating the nature of the digital source(s) for some [[CreativeWork]]. IPTCDigitalSourceEnumeration producer The person or organization who produced the work (e.g. music album, movie, TV/radio series etc.). Person contributor A secondary contributor to the CreativeWork or Event. Person isAccessibleForFree A flag to signal that the item, event, or place is accessible for free. Boolean accessibilityHazard A characteristic of the described resource that is physiologically dangerous to some users. Related to WCAG 2.0 guideline 2.3. Values should be drawn from the approved vocabulary . Text about The subject matter of the content. Thing countryOfOrigin The country of origin of something, including products as well as creative works such as movie and TV content. In the case of TV and movie, this would be the country of the principle offices of the production company or individual responsible for the movie. For other kinds of [[CreativeWork]] it is difficult to provide fully general guidance, and properties such as [[contentLocation]] and [[locationCreated]] may be more applicable. In the case of products, the country of origin of the product. The exact interpretation of this may vary by context and product type, and cannot be fully enumerated here. Country encodings A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. MediaObject locationCreated The location where the CreativeWork was created, which may not be the same as the location depicted in the CreativeWork. Place maintainer A maintainer of a [[Dataset]], software package ([[SoftwareApplication]]), or other [[Project]]. A maintainer is a [[Person]] or [[Organization]] that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on \"upstream\" sources. When [[maintainer]] is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a [[Dataset]], it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The [[isBasedOn]] property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work. Person inLanguage The language of the content or performance or used in an action. Please use one of the language codes from the IETF BCP 47 standard . See also [[availableLanguage]]. Text assesses The item being described is intended to assess the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. Text editEIDR An EIDR (Entertainment Identifier Registry) [[identifier]] representing a specific edit / edition for a work of film or television. For example, the motion picture known as \"Ghostbusters\" whose [[titleEIDR]] is \"10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J\" has several edits, e.g. \"10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I\" and \"10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3\". Since schema.org types like [[Movie]] and [[TVEpisode]] can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use [[titleEIDR]] alone (for a general description), or alongside [[editEIDR]] for a more edit-specific description. URL pattern A pattern that something has, for example 'polka dot', 'striped', 'Canadian flag'. Values are typically expressed as text, although links to controlled value schemes are also supported. Text citation A citation or reference to another creative work, such as another publication, web page, scholarly article, etc. Text encoding A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for associatedMedia. MediaObject accessibilitySummary A human-readable summary of specific accessibility features or deficiencies, consistent with the other accessibility metadata but expressing subtleties such as \"short descriptions are present but long descriptions will be needed for non-visual users\" or \"short descriptions are present and no long descriptions are needed\". Text isBasedOn A resource from which this work is derived or from which it is a modification or adaptation. URL teaches The item being described is intended to help a person learn the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. Text accessibilityAPI Indicates that the resource is compatible with the referenced accessibility API. Values should be drawn from the approved vocabulary . Text version The version of the CreativeWork embodied by a specified resource. Text size A standardized size of a product or creative work, specified either through a simple textual string (for example 'XL', '32Wx34L'), a QuantitativeValue with a unitCode, or a comprehensive and structured [[SizeSpecification]]; in other cases, the [[width]], [[height]], [[depth]] and [[weight]] properties may be more applicable. Text isBasedOnUrl A resource that was used in the creation of this resource. This term can be repeated for multiple sources. For example, http://example.com/great-multiplication-intro.html. URL contentRating Official rating of a piece of content\u2014for example, 'MPAA PG-13'. Text aggregateRating The overall rating, based on a collection of reviews or ratings, of the item. AggregateRating creator The creator/author of this CreativeWork. This is the same as the Author property for CreativeWork. Person publication A publication event associated with the item. PublicationEvent workTranslation A work that is a translation of the content of this work. E.g. \u897f\u904a\u8a18 has an English workTranslation \u201cJourney to the West\u201d, a German workTranslation \u201cMonkeys Pilgerfahrt\u201d and a Vietnamese translation T\u00e2y du k\u00fd b\u00ecnh kh\u1ea3o. CreativeWork releasedEvent The place and time the release was issued, expressed as a PublicationEvent. PublicationEvent commentCount The number of comments this CreativeWork (e.g. Article, Question or Answer) has received. This is most applicable to works published in Web sites with commenting system; additional comments may exist elsewhere. Integer copyrightNotice Text of a notice appropriate for describing the copyright aspects of this Creative Work, ideally indicating the owner of the copyright for the Work. Text educationalAlignment An alignment to an established educational framework. This property should not be used where the nature of the alignment can be described using a simple property, for example to express that a resource [[teaches]] or [[assesses]] a competency. AlignmentObject author The author of this content or rating. Please note that author is special in that HTML 5 provides a special mechanism for indicating authorship via the rel tag. That is equivalent to this and may be used interchangeably. Person exampleOfWork A creative work that this work is an example/instance/realization/derivation of. CreativeWork temporal The \"temporal\" property can be used in cases where more specific properties (e.g. [[temporalCoverage]], [[dateCreated]], [[dateModified]], [[datePublished]]) are not known to be appropriate. Text keywords Keywords or tags used to describe some item. Multiple textual entries in a keywords list are typically delimited by commas, or by repeating the property. URL accountablePerson Specifies the Person that is legally accountable for the CreativeWork. Person archivedAt Indicates a page or other link involved in archival of a [[CreativeWork]]. In the case of [[MediaReview]], the items in a [[MediaReviewItem]] may often become inaccessible, but be archived by archival, journalistic, activist, or law enforcement organizations. In such cases, the referenced page may not directly publish the content. WebPage correction Indicates a correction to a [[CreativeWork]], either via a [[CorrectionComment]], textually or in another document. URL funder A person or organization that supports (sponsors) something through some kind of financial contribution. Person provider The service provider, service operator, or service performer; the goods producer. Another party (a seller) may offer those services or goods on behalf of the provider. A provider may also serve as the seller. Person interactivityType The predominant mode of learning supported by the learning resource. Acceptable values are 'active', 'expositive', or 'mixed'. Text material A material that something is made from, e.g. leather, wool, cotton, paper. URL offers An offer to provide this item\u2014for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use [[businessFunction]] to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a [[Demand]]. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer. Offer copyrightHolder The party holding the legal copyright to the CreativeWork. Person editor Specifies the Person who edited the CreativeWork. Person materialExtent The quantity of the materials being described or an expression of the physical space they occupy. Text fileFormat Media type, typically MIME format (see IANA site ) of the content, e.g. application/zip of a SoftwareApplication binary. In cases where a CreativeWork has several media type representations, 'encoding' can be used to indicate each MediaObject alongside particular fileFormat information. Unregistered or niche file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia entry. URL genre Genre of the creative work, broadcast channel or group. URL reviews Review of the item. Review publishingPrinciples The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via [[URL]]) a document describing the editorial principles of an [[Organization]] (or individual, e.g. a [[Person]] writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a [[CreativeWork]] (e.g. [[NewsArticle]]) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the [[CreativeWork]]. While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a [[funder]]) can be expressed using schema.org terminology. URL accessibilityFeature Content features of the resource, such as accessible media, alternatives and supported enhancements for accessibility. Values should be drawn from the approved vocabulary . Text spatialCoverage The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York. Place sdDatePublished Indicates the date on which the current structured data was generated / published. Typically used alongside [[sdPublisher]]. Date conditionsOfAccess Conditions that affect the availability of, or method(s) of access to, an item. Typically used for real world items such as an [[ArchiveComponent]] held by an [[ArchiveOrganization]]. This property is not suitable for use as a general Web access control mechanism. It is expressed only in natural language.\\n\\nFor example \"Available by appointment from the Reading Room\" or \"Accessible only from logged-in accounts \". Text thumbnail Thumbnail image for an image or video. ImageObject sponsor A person or organization that supports a thing through a pledge, promise, or financial contribution. E.g. a sponsor of a Medical Study or a corporate sponsor of an event. Person isPartOf Indicates an item or CreativeWork that this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense), is part of. URL copyrightYear The year during which the claimed copyright for the CreativeWork was first asserted. Number dateCreated The date on which the CreativeWork was created or the item was added to a DataFeed. DateTime position The position of an item in a series or sequence of items. Text educationalLevel The level in terms of progression through an educational or training context. Examples of educational levels include 'beginner', 'intermediate' or 'advanced', and formal sets of level indicators. URL temporalCoverage The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format . In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written \"2011/2012\"). Other forms of content, e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode, may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via \"1939/1945\". Open-ended date ranges can be written with \"..\" in place of the end date. For example, \"2015-11/..\" indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. URL typicalAgeRange The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'. Text publisher The publisher of the creative work. Person sdPublisher Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site. For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing content with more explicitly structured metadata. The [[sdPublisher]] property helps make such practices more explicit. Person workExample Example/instance/realization/derivation of the concept of this creative work. E.g. the paperback edition, first edition, or e-book. CreativeWork video An embedded video object. VideoObject accessibilityControl Identifies input methods that are sufficient to fully control the described resource. Values should be drawn from the approved vocabulary .

Text funding A [[Grant]] that directly or indirectly provide funding or sponsorship for this item. See also [[ownershipFundingInfo]]. Grant learningResourceType The predominant type or kind characterizing the learning resource. For example, 'presentation', 'handout'. Text usageInfo The schema.org [[usageInfo]] property indicates further information about a [[CreativeWork]]. This property is applicable both to works that are freely available and to those that require payment or other transactions. It can reference additional information, e.g. community expectations on preferred linking and citation conventions, as well as purchasing details. For something that can be commercially licensed, usageInfo can provide detailed, resource-specific information about licensing options. This property can be used alongside the license property which indicates license(s) applicable to some piece of content. The usageInfo property can provide information about other licensing options, e.g. acquiring commercial usage rights for an image that is also available under non-commercial creative commons licenses. URL audio An embedded audio object. MusicRecording comment Comments, typically from users. Comment award An award won by or for this item. Text alternativeHeadline A secondary title of the CreativeWork. Text expires Date the content expires and is no longer useful or available. For example a [[VideoObject]] or [[NewsArticle]] whose availability or relevance is time-limited, a [[ClaimReview]] fact check whose publisher wants to indicate that it may no longer be relevant (or helpful to highlight) after some date, or a [[Certification]] the validity has expired.
