    - 'Media type typically expressed using a MIME format (see [IANA site](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml)
      and [MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types)),
      e.g. application/zip for a SoftwareApplication binary, audio/mpeg for .mp3 etc.


      In cases where a [[CreativeWork]] has several media type representations, [[encoding]]
      can be used to indicate each [[MediaObject]] alongside particular [[encodingFormat]]
      information.


      Unregistered or niche encoding and file formats can be indicated instead via
      the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia/Wikidata entry.'

  endTime:
    name: endTime
    comments:
    - The endTime of something. For a reserved event or service (e.g. FoodEstablishmentReservation),
      the time that it is expected to end. For actions that span a period of time,
      when the action was performed. E.g. John wrote a book from January to *December*.
      For media, including audio and video, it's the time offset of the end of a clip
      within a larger file.\n\nNote that Event uses startDate/endDate instead of startTime/endTime,
      even when describing dates with times. This situation may be clarified in future
      revisions.

      may have many media objects associated with it on the same web page. For example,
      a page about a single song (MusicRecording) may have a music video (VideoObject),
      and a high and low bandwidth audio stream (2 AudioObject's).
