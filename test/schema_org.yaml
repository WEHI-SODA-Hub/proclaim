      \ indicating a time period in [ISO 8601 time interval format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals).\
      \ In\n      the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time\
      \ period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011\
      \ would be written \"2011/2012\"). Other forms of content, e.g. ScholarlyArticle,\
      \ Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode, may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader\
      \ terms - textually or via well-known URL.\n      Written works such as books\
      \ may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939\
      \ - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via \"1939/1945\"\
      .\n\nOpen-ended date ranges can be written with \"..\" in place of the end date.\
      \ For example, \"2015-11/..\" indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and\

      1.) *id-value* URL references - uses *id-value* of an element in the page being\

      \ CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, e.g. via class attribute.\
      \ Use the [[cssSelector]] property.\n\n3.)  XPaths - addresses content via XPaths\
      \ (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the [[xpath]] property.\n\n\nFor\
      \ more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references,\

    - 'A Global Trade Item Number ([GTIN](https://www.gs1.org/standards/id-keys/gtin)).
      GTINs identify trade items, including products and services, using numeric identification
      codes.


      A correct [[gtin]] value should be a valid GTIN, which means that it should
      be an all-numeric string of either 8, 12, 13 or 14 digits, or a "GS1 Digital
      Link" URL based on such a string. The numeric component should also have a [valid
      GS1 check digit](https://www.gs1.org/services/check-digit-calculator) and meet
      the other rules for valid GTINs. See also [GS1''s GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin)
      and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Trade_Item_Number) for
      more details. Left-padding of the gtin values is not required or encouraged.
      The [[gtin]] property generalizes the earlier [[gtin8]], [[gtin12]], [[gtin13]],
      and [[gtin14]] properties.


      The GS1 [digital link specifications](https://www.gs1.org/standards/Digital-Link/)
      expresses GTINs as URLs (URIs, IRIs, etc.).

      Digital Links should be populated into the [[hasGS1DigitalLink]] attribute.


      Note also that this is a definition for how to include GTINs in Schema.org data,
      and not a definition of GTINs in general - see the GS1 documentation for authoritative

    - "A technique, method or technology used in an [[Observation]], [[StatisticalVariable]]\
      \ or [[Dataset]] (or [[DataDownload]], [[DataCatalog]]), corresponding to the\
      \ method used for measuring the corresponding variable(s) (for datasets, described\
      \ using [[variableMeasured]]; for [[Observation]], a [[StatisticalVariable]]).\
      \ Often but not necessarily each [[variableMeasured]] will have an explicit\
      \ representation as (or mapping to) an property such as those defined in Schema.org,\
      \ or other RDF vocabularies and \"knowledge graphs\". In that case the subproperty\
      \ of [[variableMeasured]] called [[measuredProperty]] is applicable.\n    \n\
      The [[measurementTechnique]] property helps when extra clarification is needed\
      \ about how a [[measuredProperty]] was measured. This is oriented towards scientific\
      \ and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is\
      \ not intended as a full representation of measurement, but can often serve\
      \ as a high level summary for dataset discovery. \n\nFor example, if [[variableMeasured]]\
      \ is: molecule concentration, [[measurementTechnique]] could be: \"mass spectrometry\"\
      \ or \"nmr spectroscopy\" or \"colorimetry\" or \"immunofluorescence\". If the\
      \ [[variableMeasured]] is \"depression rating\", the [[measurementTechnique]]\
      \ could be \"Zung Scale\" or \"HAM-D\" or \"Beck Depression Inventory\". \n\n\
      If there are several [[variableMeasured]] properties recorded for some given\
      \ data object, use a [[PropertyValue]] for each [[variableMeasured]] and attach\
      \ the corresponding [[measurementTechnique]]. The value can also be from an\
      \ enumeration, organized as a [[MeasurementMetholdEnumeration]]."

  EndorsementRating:

    - 'An EndorsementRating is a rating that expresses some level of endorsement,
      for example inclusion in a "critic''s pick" blog, a

      "Like" or "+1" on a social network. It can be considered the [[result]] of an
      [[EndorseAction]] in which the [[object]] of the action is rated positively
      by

      some [[agent]]. As is common elsewhere in schema.org, it is sometimes more useful
      to describe the results of such an action without explicitly describing the
      [[Action]].


      An [[EndorsementRating]] may be part of a numeric scale or organized system,
      but this is not required: having an explicit type for indicating a positive,

      endorsement rating is particularly useful in the absence of numeric scales as
      it helps consumers understand that the rating is broadly positive.

    - The causative agent(s) that are responsible for the pathophysiologic process

      unless otherwise specified this is meant to be the proximate cause of the medical
      condition, symptom or sign. The proximate cause is defined as the causative
      agent that most directly results in the medical condition, symptom or sign.
      For example, the HIV virus could be considered a cause of AIDS. Or in a diagnostic
      context, if a patient fell and sustained a hip fracture and two days later sustained
      a pulmonary embolism which eventuated in a cardiac arrest, the cause of the
      cardiac arrest (the proximate cause) would be the pulmonary embolism and not
      the fall. Medical causes can include cardiovascular, chemical, dermatologic,
      endocrine, environmental, gastroenterologic, genetic, hematologic, gynecologic,
      iatrogenic, infectious, musculoskeletal, neurologic, nutritional, obstetric,

  Protein:

    comments:
    - Protein is here used in its widest possible definition, as classes of amino
      acid based molecules. Amyloid-beta Protein in human (UniProt P05067), eukaryota
      (e.g. an OrthoDB group) or even a single molecule that one can point to are
      all of type :Protein. A protein can thus be a subclass of another protein, e.g.
      :Protein as a UniProt record can have multiple isoforms inside it which would
      also be :Protein. They can be imagined, synthetic, hypothetical or naturally
      occurring.

      a period of time. In an observational study, the assignment of subjects into
      treatment groups versus control groups is outside the control of the investigator.
      This is in contrast with controlled studies, such as the randomized controlled
      trials represented by MedicalTrial, where each subject is randomly assigned
      to a treatment group or a control group before the start of the treatment.

      \ share some unifying characteristic. For example, \"The Olympic Games\" is\
      \ a series, which\nis repeated regularly. The \"2012 London Olympics\" can be\
      \ presented both as an [[Event]] in the series \"Olympic Games\", and as an\n\
      [[EventSeries]] that included a number of sporting competitions as Events.\n\
      \nThe nature of the association between the events in an [[EventSeries]] can\
      \ vary, but typical examples could\ninclude a thematic event series (e.g. topical\
      \ meetups or classes), or a series of regular events that share a location,\
      \ attendee group and/or organizers.\n\nEventSeries has been defined as a kind\
      \ of Event to make it easy for publishers to use it in an Event context without\n\
      worrying about which kinds of series are really event-like enough to call an\
      \ Event. In general an EventSeries\nmay seem more Event-like when the period\
      \ of time is compact and when aspects such as location are fixed, but\nit may\
      \ also sometimes prove useful to describe a longer-term series as an Event.\n\

  SuperficialAnatomy:

    comments:
    - Anatomical features that can be observed by sight (without dissection), including
      the form and proportions of the human body as well as surface landmarks that
      correspond to deeper subcutaneous structures. Superficial anatomy plays an important
      role in sports medicine, phlebotomy, and other medical specialties as underlying
      anatomical structures can be identified through surface palpation. For example,
      during back surgery, superficial anatomy can be used to palpate and count vertebrae
      to find the site of incision. Or in phlebotomy, superficial anatomy can be used
      to locate an underlying vein; for example, the median cubital vein can be located
      by palpating the borders of the cubital fossa (such as the epicondyles of the
      humerus) and then looking for the superficial signs of the vein, such as size,
      prominence, ability to refill after depression, and feel of surrounding tissue
      support. As another example, in a subluxation (dislocation) of the glenohumeral
      joint, the bony structure becomes pronounced with the deltoid muscle failing
      to cover the glenohumeral joint allowing the edges of the scapula to be superficially
      visible. Here, the superficial anatomy is the visible edges of the scapula,
      implying the underlying dislocation of the joint (the related anatomical structure).

    - 'A StatisticalPopulation is a set of instances of a certain given type that
      satisfy some set of constraints. The property [[populationType]] is used to
      specify the type. Any property that can be used on instances of that type can
      appear on the statistical population. For example, a [[StatisticalPopulation]]
      representing all [[Person]]s with a [[homeLocation]] of East Podunk California
      would be described by applying the appropriate [[homeLocation]] and [[populationType]]
      properties to a [[StatisticalPopulation]] item that stands for that set of people.

      The properties [[numConstraints]] and [[constraintProperty]] are used to specify
      which of the populations properties are used to specify the population. Note
      that the sense of "population" used here is the general sense of a statistical

      population, and does not imply that the population consists of people. For example,
      a [[populationType]] of [[Event]] or [[NewsArticle]] could be used. See also
      [[Observation]], where a [[populationType]] such as [[Person]] or [[Event]]
      can be indicated directly. In most cases it may be better to use [[StatisticalVariable]]

      In British English a campsite is an area, usually divided into a number of pitches,
      where people can camp overnight using tents or camper vans or caravans; this
      British English use of the word is synonymous with the American English expression
      campground. In American English the term campsite generally means an area where
      an individual, family, group, or military unit can pitch a tent or park a camper;
      a campground may contain many campsites (source: Wikipedia, see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campsite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campsite)).\n\n

  StatisticalVariable:
    name: StatisticalVariable
    comments:
    - '[[StatisticalVariable]] represents any type of statistical metric that can
      be measured at a place and time. The usage pattern for [[StatisticalVariable]]
      is typically expressed using [[Observation]] with an explicit [[populationType]],
      which is a type, typically drawn from Schema.org. Each [[StatisticalVariable]]
      is marked as a [[ConstraintNode]], meaning that some properties (those listed
      using [[constraintProperty]]) serve in this setting solely to define the statistical
      variable rather than literally describe a specific person, place or thing. For
      example, a [[StatisticalVariable]] Median_Height_Person_Female representing
      the median height of women, could be written as follows: the population type
      is [[Person]]; the measuredProperty [[height]]; the [[statType]] [[median]];
      the [[gender]] [[Female]]. It is important to note that there are many kinds
      of scientific quantitative observation which are not fully, perfectly or unambiguously
      described following this pattern, or with solely Schema.org terminology. The
      approach taken here is designed to allow partial, incremental or minimal description
      of [[StatisticalVariable]]s, and the use of detailed sets of entity and property
      IDs from external repositories. The [[measurementMethod]], [[unitCode]] and
      [[unitText]] properties can also be used to clarify the specific nature and
      notation of an observed measurement. '

  SpecialAnnouncement:
    name: SpecialAnnouncement
    comments:
    - "A SpecialAnnouncement combines a simple date-stamped textual information update\n\
      \      with contextualized Web links and other structured data.  It represents\
      \ an information update made by a\n      locally-oriented organization, for\
      \ example schools, pharmacies, healthcare providers,  community groups, police,\n\
      \      local government.\n\nFor work in progress guidelines on Coronavirus-related\
      \ markup see [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ikaGCKxo50rRM7nvKSlbUpjyIk2WMQd3IkB1lItlrM/edit#).\n\
      \nThe motivating scenario for SpecialAnnouncement is the [Coronavirus pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic),\
      \ and the initial vocabulary is oriented to this urgent situation. Schema.org\n\
      expect to improve the markup iteratively as it is deployed and as feedback emerges\
      \ from use. In addition to our\nusual [Github entry](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490),\
      \ feedback comments can also be provided in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#).\n\
      \n\nWhile this schema is designed to communicate urgent crisis-related information,\
      \ it is not the same as an emergency warning technology like [CAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol),\
      \ although there may be overlaps. The intent is to cover\nthe kinds of everyday\
      \ practical information being posted to existing websites during an emergency\
      \ situation.\n\nSeveral kinds of information can be provided:\n\nWe encourage\
      \ the provision of \"name\", \"text\", \"datePosted\", \"expires\" (if appropriate),\
      \ \"category\" and\n\"url\" as a simple baseline. It is important to provide\
      \ a value for \"category\" where possible, most ideally as a well known\nURL\
      \ from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic,\
      \ this should be \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20\\_coronavirus\\\
      _pandemic\" or \"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910\".\n\nFor many of the\
      \ possible properties, values can either be simple links or an inline description,\
      \ depending on whether a summary is available. For a link, provide just the\
      \ URL of the appropriate page as the property's value. For an inline description,\
      \ use a [[WebContent]] type, and provide the url as a property of that, alongside\
      \ at least a simple \"[[text]]\" summary of the page. It is\nunlikely that a\
      \ single SpecialAnnouncement will need all of the possible properties simultaneously.\n\
      \nWe expect that in many cases the page referenced might contain more specialized\
      \ structured data, e.g. contact info, [[openingHours]], [[Event]], [[FAQPage]]\
      \ etc. By linking to those pages from a [[SpecialAnnouncement]] you can help\
      \ make it clearer that the events are related to the situation (e.g. Coronavirus)\
      \ indicated by the [[category]] property of the [[SpecialAnnouncement]].\n\n\
      Many [[SpecialAnnouncement]]s will relate to particular regions and to identifiable\
      \ local organizations. Use [[spatialCoverage]] for the region, and [[announcementLocation]]\
      \ to indicate specific [[LocalBusiness]]es and [[CivicStructure]]s. If the announcement\
      \ affects both a particular region and a specific location (for example, a library\
      \ closure that serves an entire region), use both [[spatialCoverage]] and [[announcementLocation]].\n\
      \nThe [[about]] property can be used to indicate entities that are the focus\
      \ of the announcement. We now recommend using [[about]] only\nfor representing\
      \ non-location entities (e.g. a [[Course]] or a [[RadioStation]]). For places,\
      \ use [[announcementLocation]] and [[spatialCoverage]]. Consumers of this markup\
      \ should be aware that the initial design encouraged the use of [[about]] for\
      \ locations too.\n\nThe basic content of [[SpecialAnnouncement]] is similar\
      \ to that of an [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) or [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard))\
      \ feed. For publishers without such feeds, basic feed-like information can be\
      \ shared by posting\n[[SpecialAnnouncement]] updates in a page, e.g. using JSON-LD.\
      \ For sites with Atom/RSS functionality, you can point to a feed\nwith the [[webFeed]]\
      \ property. This can be a simple URL, or an inline [[DataFeed]] object, with\
      \ [[encodingFormat]] providing\nmedia type information, e.g. \"application/rss+xml\"\
      \ or \"application/atom+xml\".\n"

    - 'A [[CampingPitch]] is an individual place for overnight stay in the outdoors,

      In British English a campsite, or campground, is an area, usually divided into
      a number of pitches, where people can camp overnight using tents or camper vans
      or caravans; this British English use of the word is synonymous with the American
      English expression campground. In American English the term campsite generally
      means an area where an individual, family, group, or military unit can pitch
      a tent or park a camper; a campground may contain many campsites.

      \nIn practice many news publishers produce a wide variety of article types,\

      \ For example, opinion pieces, reviews, analysis, sponsored or satirical articles,\
      \ or articles that combine several of these elements.\n\nThe [[ReportageNewsArticle]]\
      \ type is based on a stricter ideal for \"news\" as a work of journalism, with\
      \ articles based on factual information either observed or verified by the author,\
      \ or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.  This often includes\
      \ perspectives from multiple viewpoints on a particular issue (distinguishing\
      \ news reports from public relations or propaganda).  News reports in the [[ReportageNewsArticle]]\
      \ sense de-emphasize the opinion of the author, with commentary and value judgements\
      \ typically expressed elsewhere.\n\nA [[ReportageNewsArticle]] which goes deeper\
